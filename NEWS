2014-08-17 - Version 0.6.1
- plot.rc and friends now return invisibly the coordinates of the plotted
  category points, for use in adding further plot annotations.
- plot.rc and friends now provide an ellipse.col argument for the confidence
  ellipses plotted with the \code{conf.ellipses} argument.
- plot.assoc now handles the special case of RC(1) models, giving a dotchart
  of the category scores.

2014-03-10 - Version 0.6
- COMPATIBILITY BREAK: store marginal weights for each layer instead
  of only the global average. Saved models will have to be fit again
  in order to be plotted.
- Report BIC/AIC variant equal to 0 for the saturated model.
- Allow fitting association models with complex survey designs
  ('survey' package) via svy* functions.
- Fix direction of skewness in hmskew and hmskewL models, which could
  be wrong in some special cases.
- Added support for Mean Absolute Odds Ratio (MAOR) in new maor()
  function, and with association and UNIDIFF models.
- Added support for supplementary/passive rows and columns for rc and
  hmskew models.
- For association model plots, make area of symbols proportional to the
  weights rather than to their square.
- Plot average association by default for RC-L models, and support
  rotating the axes to those with highest variance.
- New 'add' argument to plot.unidiff() to allow representing several
  models in one figure; also change the default plot type to points.
- Accept start=NA to use good default values.
- Use eliminate more aggressively to greatly improve performance.
- Make fitting UNIDIFF models more robust by not constraining coefficient
  which do not stricly need to be constrained (reported by Gina Potarca).
- Fix using multiple CPUs for jackknife/bootstrap.
- Drop snow support (the parallel package must be used instead).
- Use load balancing for large models with jackknife/bootstrap.
- Do not fail with tables without dimension names.
- Allow passing checkEstimability=FALSE to unidiff() for performance.
- Accept nd.symm=0 in hmskew() and hmskewL().
- Print layer coefficients from print.unidiff().
- Documentation fixes.
