2016-01-13 - Version 0.6.3
- Fix computing standard errors with ncpus > 1.
- Add svygnm() function, equivalent for generalized nonlinear models
  to svyglm() from package survey.
- Add ras() function to run RAS/Demming-Stephan algorithm
- Allow computing symmetric and antisymmetric components of MAOR
- Allow regression-type (Goodman-Hout) symmetric association in hmskew models
- Change (undocumented) definition of unweighted MAOR
- Fix plotting association models with layers and diagonal when keeping default arguments
- Plot variable names next to arrow in hmskew models
- Fix calling anova() on logmult objects (noticed by Heather Turner)
- Accept type="n" and add=TRUE arguments in plot.assoc()
- Fix references in docs

2015-04-22 - Version 0.6.2
- Fix yrskew to be compatible with gnm version 1.0-8 (thanks to Heather Turner).

2015-01-13 - Version 0.6.1
- Support 1D association plots using dotchart().
- Add col.ellipses argument to plot.assoc() functions (based on work by Michael Friendly).
- Avoid plotting confidence bars outside of box in plot.assoc().
- Plot first layer instead of failing by default for heterogeneous RC-L.
- Return coordinates of plotted points from plot.assoc().
- Support three-way tables and NA cells in maor().
- Improve documentation for maor().
- Do not fail when dimension names are empty or not unique.
- Fix comments in documentation (spotted by Michael Friendly).
- Various small fixes.

2014-03-10 - Version 0.6
- COMPATIBILITY BREAK: store marginal weights for each layer instead
  of only the global average. Saved models will have to be fit again
  in order to be plotted.
- Report BIC/AIC variant equal to 0 for the saturated model.
- Allow fitting association models with complex survey designs
  ('survey' package) via svy* functions.
- Fix direction of skewness in hmskew and hmskewL models, which could
  be wrong in some special cases.
- Added support for Mean Absolute Odds Ratio (MAOR) in new maor()
  function, and with association and UNIDIFF models.
- Added support for supplementary/passive rows and columns for rc and
  hmskew models.
- For association model plots, make area of symbols proportional to the
  weights rather than to their square.
- Plot average association by default for RC-L models, and support
  rotating the axes to those with highest variance.
- New 'add' argument to plot.unidiff() to allow representing several
  models in one figure; also change the default plot type to points.
- Accept start=NA to use good default values.
- Use eliminate more aggressively to greatly improve performance.
- Make fitting UNIDIFF models more robust by not constraining coefficient
  which do not stricly need to be constrained (reported by Gina Potarca).
- Fix using multiple CPUs for jackknife/bootstrap.
- Drop snow support (the parallel package must be used instead).
- Use load balancing for large models with jackknife/bootstrap.
- Do not fail with tables without dimension names.
- Allow passing checkEstimability=FALSE to unidiff() for performance.
- Accept nd.symm=0 in hmskew() and hmskewL().
- Print layer coefficients from print.unidiff().
- Documentation fixes.

2012-09-29 - Version 0.5
- Initial release.
