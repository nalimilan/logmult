Description: Functions to fit log-multiplicative models using gnm, with
  support for convenient printing, plots, and jackknife/bootstrap
  standard errors. Currently supported models include UNIDIFF (Erikson
  & Goldthorpe), a.k.a. log-multiplicative layer effect model (Xie), and
  several association models: Goodman's row-column association models
  of the RC(M) and RC(M)-L families resp. for two- and three-way tables
  with one or several dimensions; two skew-symmetric association
  models proposed by Yamaguchi and by van der Heijden & Mooijaart.
