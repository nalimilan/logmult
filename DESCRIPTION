Description: Functions to easily fit and plot several variants of log-multiplicative
  row-column association models, building on the gnm package. Supported models include
  the RC(M) family (a.k.a. Goodman models), and two skew-symmetric models suggested by
  Yamaguchi and by van der Heijden & Mooijaart. Jackknife standard errors are optionally
  computed for the association parameters.
