\arguments{
  \item{x}{an association model, or an object inheriting from class \code{assoc}.}
  \item{dim}{numerical vector of length 2 indicating the dimensions to plot on horizontal
             and vertical axes respectively; default is first dimension horizontal and second
             dimension vertical.}
  \item{layer}{integer indicating which layer should be represented, or \dQuote{average} or
               \dQuote{average.rotate} when scores are homogeneous (see \dQuote{Details below}).}
  \item{what}{for \code{rc} and \code{assoc} objects, whether points corresponding to rows, columns
              or both should be plotted; for \code{hmskew} and \code{yrcskew} objects, what association
              should be plotted.}
  \item{which}{an optional subset of points to be plotted, specified via a logical, integer or character
               vector indexing the row or column component of the association object; if \code{what = both},
               a list of two such vectors, resp. for rows and columns.}
  \item{mass}{whether the size of the point symbols should reflect on the mass of the categories;
              this only makes sense when marginal weights were used when fitting the model. The precise
              formula is that the \code{pch} of a symbol is equal to the \code{pch} argument, times the
              weight of the category divided by average weight.}
  \item{luminosity}{whether the luminosity of the symbols should vary according to the diagonal-specific
                    parameters (if \code{diagonal = TRUE} was passed when fitting the model); if \code{TRUE},
                    hue and saturation of \code{col} are taken as a base, and value varies from 0 to 0.8
                    as a linear function of the diagonal parameter values.}
  \item{arrow}{Numeric value indicating the angle at which the polar coordinates system arrow should be plotted;
               use NULL for no arrow.}
  \item{conf.ellipses}{an integer between 0 and 1 giving the confidence level to use when drawing error ellipses
                       around the points (see \dQuote{Details} below); by default nothing is plotted. Only possible
                       if jackknife or bootstrap was enabled when fitting the model.}
  \item{replicates}{whether to plot points representing the values of the scores obtained for all of the
                    jackknife of bootrap replicates, when applicable (see \dQuote{Details} below).}
  \item{coords}{whether to use a Cartesian or a polar coordinate system; the former makes sense when axes
                offer an interpretation (like in RC(M) models), while the latter are more appropriate when
                only the angle and distance to origin are of interest (like in \code{hmskew} models).}
  \item{rev.axes}{a numeric of length 1 or 2 indicating whether the sign of scores on the axes should be changed;
                  as this sign is arbitrary in RC(M) models, changing it has no incidence on the results and may
                  be more intuitive or consistent with other presentations.}
  \item{cex}{a numeric vector indicating the size of the point symbols, recycled as necessary; the most common
             choice is probably to pass only one value and use \code{mass} to make the size vary.}
  \item{col}{a vector indicating the color of the point symbols, recycled as necessary; as a special case, a
             vector of length 2 can be passed, to indicate the color of row and column points, respectively.
             See also \code{luminosity}.}
  \item{groups}{a vector indicating what symbol should be used for each point, recycled as necessary; groups will
                use \code{pch} values 21, 24, 22, 23 and 25, in this order, cycling if needed. If not an integer,
                the number of the factor level will be used.}
  \item{xlim}{numeric vector of length 2, giving the x coordinates range.}
  \item{ylim}{numeric vector of length 2, giving the y coordinates range.}
  \item{asp}{the y/x aspect ratio, see \code{\link{plot.window}}.}
  \item{xlab}{a title for the x axis: see \code{\link{title}}. For RC(M) axes and Cartesian coordinates,
              the default is \dQuote{Dimension N (phi)}; it is empty in other cases where axes have no meaning.}
  \item{ylab}{a title for the y axis: see \code{\link{title}}. For RC(M) axes and Cartesian coordinates,
              the default is \dQuote{Dimension N (phi)}; it is empty in other cases where axes have no meaning.}
  \item{main}{an overall title for the plot: see \code{\link{title}}. If missing for RC(M)-L models, the name of
              the plotted layer will be used.}
  \item{pch}{a vector of plotting \sQuote{character}, i.e., symbol to use for each point, recycled as necessary;
             see \code{\link{points}}.}
  \item{font}{an integer vector indicating the font to use for each label, recycled as necessary;
              see \code{link{par}}.}
  \item{ellipse.col}{a vector indicating the colors of the confidence ellipses, when these are plotted; defaults to \code{col}.}
  \item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{\link{plot}}.}

\details{
  The functions documented here represent in a one- or two-dimensional space the category scores obtained from a
  log-multiplicative association model. They produce \emph{symmetric biplots} in which the coordinates of points
  on both axes are the product of normalized scores and of the square root of the intrinsic association
  coefficient corresponding to each dimension: thus, row and column points share the same \dQuote{unit}
  on all axes (Goodman, 1991, Appendix 2; Wong, 2010, eq. 2.38; Clogg & Shihadeh, 1994, p. 91-92).

  The special case of models with only one dimension models (\code{nd=1} in \code{\link{rc} and in \code{\link{rcL}} models is presented as a dotchart
  of the row and column category scores.
  
  Various convenience options are provided, with reasonable defaults for each model family. In particular,
  you may find it necessary to adapt the \code{cex}, \code{mass}, \code{luminosity} and \code{groups} arguments
  depending on the number of categories to be plotted and to their respective weights. When plotting a RC(2) model,
  a polar coordinate system can be of substantive interest, allowing to interpret at a glance the distance to
  origin as the general strength of the association for a category on both axes (a property that is lost for
  higher-dimensional models).

  Confidence ellipses are computed from the scores' variances and covariances, based on the assumption that they are
  follow a normal distribution, even if standard errors are computed using jackknife or bootstrap. When bootstrap (not
  jackknife) was used, this normality assumption can be assessed visually using the \code{replicates} argument to check 
  whether points globally follow the shape of the ellipses. See \code{\link{se.assoc}} for details about checking the
  validity of jackknife or bootstrap results.

  When \code{layer} is set to \dQuote{average} for models with layer effect and homogeneous scores, intrinsic association
  coefficients are weighted across all layers. In addition, if \code{layer} set to \dQuote{average.rotate}, scores are
  rotated so that axes of the plot are those with the highest variance; oblique axes represent the original dimensions
  in the new space.

  The \code{plot.assoc} function is called internally by all others, and may be leveraged for advanced use cases,
  like plotting custom models that do not correspond stricly to the supported types.
