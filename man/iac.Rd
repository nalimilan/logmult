  Intrinsic Association Coefficient
}
\description{
  Compute the intrisic association coefficient of a table.
  This coefficient was first devised by Goodman (1996) as the
  \dQuote{generalized contingency} when a logarithm link is used, and it is equal
  to the standard deviation of the log-linear two-way interaction parameters
  \eqn{\lambda_{ij}}.
  To obtain the Altham index, multiply the result by
  \code{sqrt(nrow(tab) * ncol(tab)) * 2} (see \dQuote{Examples} below).
}
\usage{
iac(tab, cell = FALSE,
    weighting = c("marginal", "uniform", "none"),
    component = c("total", "symmetric", "antisymmetric"),
    shrink = FALSE,
    normalize = FALSE,
    row.weights = NULL, col.weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{tab}{a two- or three-way table without zero cells; for three-way tables,
      average marginal weighting is used when \dQuote{weighting = "marginal"}, and
      the MAOR is computed for each layer (third dimension).}
  \item{cell}{if \dQuote{TRUE}, return the per-cell contributions
       (affected by the value of \code{phi}, see \dQuote{Details} below).}
  \item{weighting}{what weights should be used when normalizing the scores.}
  \item{component}{whether to compute the total association, or from symmetric
      or antisymmetric interaction coefficients only.}
  \item{shrink}{whether to use the empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator proposed by Zhou (2015)
      rather than the direct estimator.}
  \item{normalize}{whether to return the normalized version of the index varying
      between 0 and 1 proposed by Bouchet-Valat (2022) rather than the
      classic index varying between 0 and positive infinity.}
  \item{row.weights}{optional custom weights to be used for rows, e.g. to compute
      the phi coefficient for several tables using their overall marginal
      distribution. If specified, \code{weighting} is ignored.}
  \item{col.weights}{see \code{row.weights}.}
}
\details{
  See Goodman (1996), Equation 52 for the (marginal or other) weighted version of
  the intrinsic association coefficient (\eqn{\tilde \lambda}); the unweighted version can be
  computed with unit weights. The coefficient should not be confused with Goodman and Kruskal's lambda coefficient.
  The uniform-weighted version is defined as:
  \deqn{\lambda^\dagger = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{IJ} \sum_{i = 1}^I \sum_{j = 1}^J \lambda_{ij}^2 }}
  The (marginal or other) weighted version is defined as:
  \deqn{\tilde \lambda = \sqrt{ \sum_{i = 1}^I \sum_{j = 1}^J \tilde \lambda_{ij}^2 P_{i+} P_{+j} }}
  with \eqn{\sum_{i = 1}^I \lambda_{ij} = \sum_{j = 1}^J \lambda_{ij} = 0} and
  \eqn{\sum_{i = 1}^I P_{i+} \tilde \lambda_{ij} = \sum_{j = 1}^J P_{+j} \tilde \lambda_{ij} = 0}.

  The normalized version of the index is defined from \eqn{\lambda^\dagger} and
  \eqn{\tilde \lambda} as:
  \deqn{\tau = \sqrt{1 + 1/(2 \lambda)^2} - 1/(2 \lambda)}

  Per-cell contributions \eqn{c_{ij}} are defined so that:
  \eqn{\tilde \phi = \sqrt{ \sum_{i = 1}^I \sum_{j = 1}^J c_{ij} }}. For the unweighted case,
  \eqn{c_{ij} = \lambda_{ij}^2 / IJ}; for the weighted case,
  \eqn{\tilde c_{ij} = \tilde \lambda_{ij}^2 P_{i+} P_{+j}}.

  This index cannot be computed in the presence of zero cells since it is based
  on the logarithm of proportions. In these cases, 0.5 is added to all cells of the table
  (Agresti 2002, sec. 9.8.7, p. 397; Berkson 1955), and a warning is printed.
  Make sure this correction does not affect too much the results (especially
  with small samples) by manually adding different values before calling this function.
